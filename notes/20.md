# OOP Challenges

### **1. Banking System Simulation**
Design a system to simulate a bank's operations, where users can create accounts, deposit and withdraw money, and check their account balance.  
- Extend functionality to include multiple account types (e.g., savings, current) with unique behaviors like interest calculation or overdraft limits.
- Emphasize encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism.

### **2. Library Management System**
Build a system for a library to manage books and borrowers.  
- Include operations for adding/removing books, issuing/returning books, and calculating late fees.
- Implement relationships like "A borrower can borrow multiple books, but a book can only belong to one borrower at a time."
- Have different membership plans (e.g., Student, Regular, Premium).

### **3. Hospital Patient Management**
Create a hospital management system that tracks doctors, patients, and appointments.  
- Doctors can have specialties, and patients may have different ailments.
- Each appointment should store the doctor-patient relationship, along with the date and time.
- Add functionality for doctors' schedules and ensuring no double booking.

### **4. E-Commerce Platform Prototype**
Simulate a basic e-commerce platform where customers can browse products, add them to a cart, and place orders.  
- Use OOP principles to manage inventory, pricing (e.g., discounts), and order tracking.
- Integrate functionality for calculating taxes and shipping costs dynamically.

### **5. Traffic Simulation**
Design a simulation of a traffic system in a city, including vehicles, roads, and traffic lights.  
- Vehicles (e.g., cars, buses, bikes) have different speeds and behaviors.
- Roads have capacities, and traffic lights regulate the flow.
- Add features like handling traffic jams and prioritizing emergency vehicles.

These challenges progressively test the understanding of core OOP principles like inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation, while also encouraging real-world problem-solving.
